This is an example using TAGE's networking support.
(actually it is a SAGE package adapted for TAGE)

First, you run the server's run.bat.
It then waits for clients to connect.

Next, you run a client's run.bat.
You need to make sure that the run.bat points to the IP address
of the machine where you ran the server.

The avatar is a dolphin, the ghost avatar(s) is a sphere.

You can run multiple clients, even from one computer (although that
can be a bit clumsy).

The rest of the scene is the same as example #2b.
